**Disclaimer:** This project is no longer active due to extensive misuse and bad actors.

A couple months ago, I realized that I had hit a wall in building web applications. Every project up until that point had been very similar -
some Javascript framework (Usually React or Next), a database, LLM/API calls, and CRUD functionality. It was fun doing those projects to learn

that people would genuinely use.

Over the last winter break, I started watching a Twitch streamer
